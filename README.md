# MATLAB-Data-Plotting-Tutorial
Given an Excel file, we will extract data and plot a simple graph with a choice of markers.

In this tutorial we will use an Excel data file that is attached to this repository called boston_data.xls which contains example time, air temperature, wind speed, dewpoint, etc. data. 

However we need to convert the Excel file into a .txt file in order to make the data readable for the program. To do this we would open up the boston_data.xls file on Excel, select file on the top right of the screen, select save as, select tab delimited file, and save the file into a separate project folder that will hold the additional MATLAB files. 

Nice! Now we can open up MATLAB and create a new script which is a new file where you would be writing out all your code! Let's start with naming the script by using double percentage signs (%%) which will allow us to comment and create a new header. Then let's add in the owner of the file using one perventage sign (%) which is usually used as in-line comments.
